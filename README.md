_Songs for the Trumpocalypse_ is a major, super classy book that's going to MAKE POETRY GREAT AGAIN, computationally generated from genuine Donald Trump quotations with a [recurrent neural network](https://github.com/rossgoodwin/neuralsnap) by [Ross Goodwin](http://rossgoodwin.com) for the [2016 Stupid Shit No One Needs and Terrible Ideas Hackathon](http://www.stupidhackathon.com).

Mr. Trump should consider this book a formal application for the position of United States Poet Laureate under his administration.
