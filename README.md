A major, super classy book that's going to MAKE POETRY GREAT AGAIN, computationally generated from genuine Donald Trump quotations with a [recurrent neural network](https://github.com/rossgoodwin/neuralsnap). Created for the [2016 Stupid Shit No One Needs and Terrible Ideas Hackathon](http://www.stupidhackathon.com).

President Trump should consider this book my formal application for the position of United States Poet Laureate under his administration.
